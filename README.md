# handpro
A example adapter of Calcite. For self learn. May update from time to time.

This adapter get data from not table but some APIs likes GetData() etc.
So you can just think that the datasource are functions. You can modify or add functions in HandproAPI.java to support your needs.

Now, this adapter **just** support **SCANNABLE Table**. **FILTERABLE Table** and **TRANSLATABLE table** will be supprted in the short future.

Last, welcome to contrbute to this repository.
